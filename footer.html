Tampa Bay Times [St. Petersburg, FL], 19 Oct. 2015, p. 1A. Gale In Context: Opposing Viewpoints, <a href="link.gale.com/apps/doc/A431979663/OVIC?u=cps1440&sid=bookmark-OVIC&xid=f4064f0d" link="_blank">link.gale.com/apps/doc/A431979663/OVIC?u=cps1440&sid=bookmark-OVIC&xid=f4064f0d</a></b></u>.
                            The article "Coding Skills Gain Value" by Jeffrey S. Solochek refers to a legislative proposal in Florida in 2015, that would have allowed high school students to substitute computer coding classes for foreign language requirements. Proponents argue that the skill of coding is one necessary for students entering the workforce of today; critics point to the loss of both cultural and linguistic learning in these substitutions. The discussion here reflects the increased emphasis on computer literacy in education and its future potential in creating career paths. This is symptomatic of much wider trends within educational policy, which emphasize technology and STEM fields.
                            The source, "Coding Skills Gain Value" by Jeffrey S. Solochek, helps to look at debates over education policy, focus on a particular Florida proposal, and explores the pros and cons of computer coding over traditional foreign languages. The source is credible, having been published in a well-respected newspaper, the Tampa Bay Times, and made available through Gale's, which assures its reliability.

                            The blog post "Cracking the Code" by Chicago Public Schools talks about teaching students how to code and use computer science skills. It explains programs that help students become better problem-solvers and prepare for jobs in technology. The post also focuses on making sure all students have the chance to learn coding, no matter where they come from. It shares stories from students and teachers who have benefited from these programs and shows how coding is being added to schools in the district.
                            The source “Cracking the Code | Chicago Public Schools” is reliable because it comes from Chicago Public Schools (CPS). Since CPS is a trusted source, the information is likely accurate, but it might be a little biased because they focus more on positive things about their programs and leave out any negatives to make them look better. The blog post was published on March 3, 2020, which means the information might not be up-to-date, especially if it’s about technology or programs that could have changed 
                            since then. The purpose of the article is to share information about CPS initiatives and to promote their work, so it might not include a lot of critical analysis or opposing viewpoints.

                            The article talks of a mandate to include teaching coding in the science and technology curriculum for primary school going students. The program makes sure that by the high school level, every school student is equipped with fundamentals in coding and computational thinking, and that coding has gained a place in general education, accessible to all irrespective of their background. This is a valid source; it reports on the educational policy and its stated aim. It shows that learning the skills of coding should begin earlier 
                            in life if a country wants to raise competent citizens for the future labor markets. However, it doesn't tackle the specific difficulties, like funding or shortages, which schools may undergo trying to implement the mandate.
