Preparing them for the future were jobs and other opportunities that require coding knowledge. This idea is supported by the article "Programming as a Universal Language" states that "Coding has transformed from being a niche skill for tech enthusiasts into a universal language that impacts nearly every aspect of our
                            modern lives. It is now as integral as learning traditional languages in schools." The post proves the point that we are making that kids that have the chance to learn coding at a young age can use those skills and how they are highly valued in the modern age. Lastly the article "Teachers' Essential Guide to Coding in the Classroom" by Common Sense Education gives teachers a starting point and a path to follow as they work to incorporate coding into their practice. It helps to emphasize the importance of coding as one of the most fundamental skills because of how the modern jobs are trending to needing skills in computer science.

Codings ability to express the creative minds of children encourages them to use their creativity and test things out. As they are coding it is preparing them for the future in which coding is used a lot. In the future learning to code at a young age helps individuals adapt to the present and oncoming technological advancements.

                        <span> According to "The effects of teaching coding in primary schools:" it states that early teaching of coding improves problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity among young students. It describes how early exposure to programming helps build digital literacy, a competency that has become very important in today's world. The article also highlights some of the problems in implementing coding 
                            curriculums, such as resource constraints and teacher training. This academic source is helpful for educators, policymakers, and researchers willing to examine the effectiveness of coding education. A blog post "Cracking the Code" that was posted by Chicago Public Schools talks about teaching students how to code and use computer science skills. It explains that programs that help children learn to code help students 
                            become better problem-solvers and prepare for jobs in technology.
